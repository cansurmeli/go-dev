# README

The Dockerised development environment I use when developing a Go project.

It is based on [this](https://www.integralist.co.uk/posts/dev-environments-within-docker-containers/) but I highly customised it to my needs.

This environment should be used on a per-project basis. Meaning that each time you should clone a new copy of this environment repository and isolate everything in it.

## Why Docker?

There are/could be other tools out there for environment freeze and dependency management but I use Docker and I'm pretty comfortable with it. Plus, other adjustments besides configuring Go can be made. Hence, Docker.
